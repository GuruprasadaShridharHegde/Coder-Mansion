#### You know this, üí• rectangular has four edges, triangular has three edges and my passion on coding has no edges. This is my favourite repository which I daily spent on doing some coding stuffs. 
#### I believe passion is not about doing something big, passion is doing small things with 100 %.
You know what, as a Python developer why I do code in different languages such as c/c++/java its because I always compare different programming approaches to analyze algorithms.
### Happy Coding
